              So as not to bore you, I'll leave my school career out of this.
              Many important lessons can only be found outside the classroom and
              studying for Accounting class was never my dearest thing to do.
              After my secondary school, however, I compiled my first lines of
              code and started to work as a freelancer simultaneously.

              As of now, learning to balance work and University until
              graduation teaches me to thoroughly plan and execute tasks, as
              well as focusing on the highest relevance of both sides.

              This is a list of things I will (hopefully) accomplish in this
              lifetime. The only rule is that I can't delete anything, just add
              more:
